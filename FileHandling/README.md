# FileHandling
This is a File Handling project That I completed during the training phase of junior software engineering.
Below are my understanding.


To understand his code in more professtional way.
these are the below things you need to understand.
1 LPCSTR and all other long pointer type.
2 w_string wchar tchar
3 long pointer to c_str()
4 understood the filesystem
5 wcout 
6 vector, stack, iterators, filewrite , filereade, how to retrve the file from the harddisk, bring it to RAM and close the file after the operation.
  makde directory using cpp and getting the file details including modified time.
7 recursve iterators, getting files form the directory.
8 comparing the path is file or folder.
9 String opeation: retriving the file name from the path name. 




After implementing and understanding the source code you would be able to create a "ls" command for linux and windows.
